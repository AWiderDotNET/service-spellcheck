# Mutual Aid Service: Spellchecking

Definition for the spellcheck service for AWider.NET's [mutual aid project](https://github.com/AWiderDotNET/mutual-aid).

## When Does This Service Make Sense?

This service is a good fit for you to request if:

* You have documentation of any kind stored in non-HTML (e.g. Markdown or similar)
* You'd like those docs to be spell-checked
* (Ideally) you'd like a process to be in place to spell-check those docs going forward (that way errors don't creep in)

## How Can I Request This Service for My Repository?

Open an issue at <https://github.com/AWiderDotNET/mutual-aid> to request a service.

## How Can I Help Implement This?

See the [Implementation Guide](ImplementationGuide.md) for notes on the process.

## Where Has This Been Implemented Before?

See [past requests for this service](https://github.com/AWiderDotNET/mutual-aid/labels/service%3Aspellcheck).

## I Have a Suggestion for How to Improve This Service

Awesome! Create an issue in this repository so we can discuss.
